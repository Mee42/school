# School work
Java files are seperated by directories. Inheretence labs are in a 
seperate directory because of interdependency

All projects in here are compiled with javac/ran with java in order to reduce 
dependency on IDE's, have a cleaner, more managable repo, and allow for work to 
be done on extremly low end hardware.
